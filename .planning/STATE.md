## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 109 requirements following dependency chain: types -> core -> infra -> api
- [Roadmap]: SOUL.md immutability enforced from Phase 1 (CVE-2026-25253 mitigation)
- [Roadmap]: boternity-core must never depend on boternity-infra (dependency inversion)
- [Roadmap]: Security concerns front-loaded into the phase where their attack surface first appears

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Dual-GraphQL architecture (Yoga+Pothos BFF vs async-graphql alone) needs validation in Phase 4
- [Research]: `llm` crate (graniet) v1.2.4 is newer -- may need fallback to thin reqwest wrapper if API unstable
- [Research]: LanceDB vs sqlite-vec decision deferred to Phase 3 planning
