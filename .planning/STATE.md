# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** A user can create a bot with a distinct identity, give it skills through an interactive builder, and have meaningful parallel conversations with it -- all running locally with full observability.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation + Bot Identity

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation + Bot Identity)
Plan: 3 of 6 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-10 -- Completed 01-03-PLAN.md (Bot identity system)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 3/53 (~6%)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6m 31s
- Total execution time: 19m 53s

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation + Bot Identity | 3/6 | 19m 53s | 6m 38s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4m 30s), 01-02 (5m 58s), 01-03 (9m 25s)
- Trend: slightly increasing (01-03 larger scope with parallel plan contention)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 109 requirements following dependency chain: types -> core -> infra -> api
- [Roadmap]: SOUL.md immutability enforced from Phase 1 (CVE-2026-25253 mitigation)
- [Roadmap]: boternity-core must never depend on boternity-infra (dependency inversion)
- [Roadmap]: Security concerns front-loaded into the phase where their attack surface first appears
- [01-01]: Rust 2024 edition with resolver 3 and native async fn in traits (RPITIT, no async_trait)
- [01-01]: UUID v7 for all entity IDs (time-sortable, process-local ordering)
- [01-01]: BotStatus: Active/Disabled/Archived (lifecycle states from CONTEXT.md)
- [01-01]: Identity defaults: claude-sonnet-4-20250514, temperature 0.7, max_tokens 4096
- [01-01]: Redacted wrapper pattern for secret values (custom Debug/Display)
- [01-01]: Repository traits return impl Future (RPITIT) not Box<dyn Future>
- [01-02]: Split read/write SQLite pools (8 readers, 1 writer) with WAL mode on both
- [01-02]: Private BotRow struct for SQLite-to-domain mapping (no sqlx derives on domain types)
- [01-02]: Secrets scope stored as string not FK (allows pre-provisioned keys)
- [01-02]: Sort field whitelist in list() to prevent SQL injection
- [01-02]: Transaction for soul save (INSERT + UPDATE version_count atomically)
- [01-03]: Generic services (BotService<B, S, F, H>) over trait objects -- RPITIT traits not object-safe
- [01-03]: Free functions for content generation (generate_default_soul, etc.) -- no trait bounds needed for static calls
- [01-03]: Simple line-based YAML frontmatter parser -- avoids serde_yaml dep for narrow use case
- [01-03]: LocalFileSystem auto-creates parent dirs on write -- prevents missing dir errors

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Dual-GraphQL architecture (Yoga+Pothos BFF vs async-graphql alone) needs validation in Phase 4
- [Research]: `llm` crate (graniet) v1.2.4 is newer -- may need fallback to thin reqwest wrapper if API unstable
- [Research]: LanceDB vs sqlite-vec decision deferred to Phase 3 planning
